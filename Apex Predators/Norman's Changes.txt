1. Added ability to emulate a headset
- Set up keyboard and mouse camera controls using the OVR Headset Emulator
	> hold shift and move mouse to rotate camera
	> move along x and z axis with WASD keys
	> move along y axis with mouse scroll wheel while holding shift
- Added script (KeyboardObjectControl.cs) with keyboard alternatives to gestures for using earth bending powers
	> hold and release c to throw a projectile
	> press v to create a wall
- Script takes variables from the ControllerCollisions script, if the public variables of ControllerCollisions are changed, no changes need to be made to KeyboardObjectControl
- Projectiles are instantiated at the position of the playerEntitySpawnLocation object, since the emulator cannot emulate the controllers
- Script is attached to the [object] object

2. Changed player camera to not show the player's head model
- Added a Player Model layer and excluded it form the camera's culling mask
- Moved player model to the new layer so that the camera doesn't render it
- Ensures that players don't see their own face model when using keyboard and mouse
- The mirror still shows the model

3. Added interactable buttons to the lobby, can be modified to change settings of other scripts
- Buttons trigger when anything with a collider hits the trigger collider on the button head (the red part), best triggered by throwing a projectile at it or holding a projectile and touching it
- Added toggle button prefab; these toggle a boolean value, value is currently used to determine the material of an indicator
- The toggle button prefab consists of:
	> 
- Added scale prefab; a pair of increase and decrease buttons that change an integer value, value currently determines how many indicators are on (green)
- The scale prefab consists of:
	>
- Button objects are located under Environment -> Lobby -> Text Wall in the hierarchy

4. Added multiparticipant functionality with Photon Fusion
- Added Fusion to Photon assets
- Added Fusion appID (df666712-d78b-4183-b794-9161684b9272) to Photon server settings
- Added Prototype Network Start and Prototype Runner to Managers to set up networking
- Added PlayerSpawner script to Prototype Runner
- Added a Players object to the scene to be a parent object for all players, has the 'PlayerParent' tag so it can be located by player objects
- Made changes to player prefab to add Fusion functionality
	> Added Network Object and Network Transform components to player prefab
	> Added SetPlayerParent script to player prefab to put all players into the 'players' category in the heirarchy when they spawn
- Removed player instance from scene, players are now spawned by the Prototype Runner

		> ProjectionPlane (Plane) - for displaying render texture material
		> PortalCamera (Camera) - used to create a render texture that other portals can use to display this portals destination
- Created Mirror prefab
	> Uses camera and render texture to produce mirror functionality

6. Integrated functionality to portals and created starter prefabs for the Earth Wall and Earth Projectile
- Added functionality to portals 
	> Removed skybox sphere colliders (everything in the play area was colliding with it).
	> Added Portal script to teleport any object entering a portal to the other portal.
	> Improved portal prefab to include trigger box and teleport location
