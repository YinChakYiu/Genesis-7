1. Added ability to emulate a headset
- Set up keyboard and mouse camera controls using the OVR Headset Emulator
	> hold shift and move mouse to rotate camera
	> move along x and z axis with WASD keys
	> move along y axis with mouse scroll wheel while holding shift
- Added script (KeyboardObjectControl.cs) with keyboard alternatives to gestures for using earth bending powers
	> hold and release c to throw a projectile
	> press v to create a wall
- Script takes variables from the ControllerCollisions script, if the public variables of ControllerCollisions are changed, no changes need to be made to KeyboardObjectControl
- Projectiles are instantiated at the position of the playerEntitySpawnLocation object, since the emulator cannot emulate the controllers
- Script is attached to the OVRCameraRig object

2. Moved camera so it does not see the player's face from the inside
- Excluding the player head using the camera's culling mask makes all players invisible, so it is not an option
- Ensures that players don't see their own face model when using keyboard and mouse

3. Added interactable buttons to the lobby, can be modified to change settings of other scripts
- Buttons trigger when anything with a collider hits the trigger collider on the button head (the red part), best triggered by throwing a projectile at it or holding a projectile and touching it
- Added toggle button prefab; these toggle a boolean value, value is currently used to determine the material of an indicator
- The toggle button prefab consists of:
	> An indicator sphere with a material that gets changed by the button
	> A button head that has a trigger collider that triggers the toggling of the boolean value
	> A button base that does not have a trigger
- Added scale prefab; a pair of increase and decrease buttons that change an integer value, value currently determines how many indicators are on (green)
- The scale prefab consists of:
	> An array of indicators that indicate the scale's current value
	> An increase and decrease button with a similar stucture to the toggle button
- Button objects are located under Environment -> Lobby -> Text Wall in the hierarchy

4. Added multiparticipant functionality with Photon Fusion
- Added Fusion to Photon assets
- Added Fusion appID (df666712-d78b-4183-b794-9161684b9272) to Photon server settings
- Added Player Spawner to Managers to set up networking
- Added PlayerSpawner script to Player Spawner
- Added a Players object to the scene to be a parent object for all players, has the 'PlayerParent' tag so it can be located by player objects
- Made changes to player prefab to add Fusion functionality
	> Added Network Object and Network Transform components to player prefab
	> Added SetPlayerParent script to player prefab to put all players into the 'players' category in the heirarchy when they spawn
- Removed player instance from scene, players are now spawned by the Prototype Runner
